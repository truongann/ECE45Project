% this creates a length-N array whose entries range from âˆ’Fs to Fs and 
% increment by Fs/(N - 1)
f = (-Fs/2 : Fs/(N - 1) : Fs/2);

% this creates an array of length N that represents one in the frequency 
% domain. Do this for all functions
One = fft(one);
Two = fft(two);
Three = fft(three);
Four = fft(four);

% Plot the FT of each function in the frequency domain

% Three has the most unique one so we'll choose to unscramble that
% HW2_Filter(f, -3500, 3500) is an ideal band pass filter that lets us pass
% certain frequencies into it so we can unscramble the input. The
% unscrambled output is put in the complex expression Z.
Z = Three .* HW2_Filter(f, -3500, 3500);

% Z is transformed back into the time domain through inverse fourier
% transform.
z = real(ifft(Z));

% plays the sound in the time domain at the sampling frequency Fs.
